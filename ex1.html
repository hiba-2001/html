    <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for
         a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the
          tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

          <p>The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program's code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. Most data and operating syntax are stored and accessed in the back end of a computer system.</p>
